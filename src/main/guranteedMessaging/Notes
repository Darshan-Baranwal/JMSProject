Gurantee Messaging via Acknowledgments

1. AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE - the consumer/session will not acknowledge receipt of a message since the broker assumes
                       successful receipt of a message after the onMessage handler has returned without error.
                       No separate client acknowledgment is required. Message sent only once in case of failure,
                       JMS server takes this overhead to make sure the one time delivery of the message.
2. DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE - Duplicate OK -> release the overhead of the JMS server this Acknowledgment is used.
3. CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE - the JMS consumer takes the responsibility to send the acknowledgment. JMS server is not blocked.
                        JMS consumer client will send Message.acknowledgment()
4. SESSION_TRANSACTED - Producers session transacted means the send() operation first cached and once commit() then
                        only it will move to the JMS server queue if there is any rollback then cache gets cleared and
                        send message removed.
                        Similarly session transacted in Consumers end means the receive() first cached, once commit() then
                        message taken from the JMS server queue if receive didn't go well then rollback occurred and the message
                        remains in the JMS server queue.
